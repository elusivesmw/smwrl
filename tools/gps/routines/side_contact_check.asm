;Like the muncher and spikes in SMW, merely touching the sides of them
;without moving against them doesn't harm the player, unless the player
;is 1 pixel more than what the game allows. If you're using custom player
;hitboxes, you might want to fiddle around the x position boundaries here
;so that it works as intended.
;
;Output:
;A = 0 if the player is touching without moving in towards the block.
;A = 1 if the player is moving into towards the left side of the block.
;A = 2 if the player is moving into towards the right side of the block.

!BlockHitboxPos		= $000E ;>X position displacement of the hitbox relative to block. This is the leftmost boundary.
!BlockHitboxWidth	= $001A ;>The width of the box.
;^Increasing !BlockHitboxWidth would extend the box rightwards, while changing !BlockHitboxPos would move the entire box.

!CollisionMode		= 0	;>0 = use the position-related collision detection, 1 = use actual hitbox detection
;^In case if you're too lazy with fiddling with the routine, assuming that the hitbox patches modifies the player's
; hitbox size.
